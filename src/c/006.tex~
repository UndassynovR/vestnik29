This article examines the accuracy of determining the reactivity of lime
milk, which is used as the primary reagent for the removal of heavy
metal ions from mine water. A comparison of four titrimetric methods was
conducted, differing in sample preparation conditions (grinding,
boiling), sample mass, and the use of correction coefficients. It was
found that the average reactivity of lime milk ranged from 38.2\% to
45.7\%, with an overall mean value of 42.9\% across all experiments.
These results are significantly below the regulatory range of 52-70\%
established for this reagent. The most reproducible results were
obtained using the method involving two sample masses and preliminary
grinding of the sample. The low reactivity values are attributed to the
presence of impurities (Mg, Si, Al, Fe, gypsum, sand), which reduce the
effective Ca(OH)₂ content. The study concludes that stricter quality
control of lime used for lime milk preparation is necessary, as well as
an adjustment of the technological regulations for reagent dosing at
treatment facilities.

{\bfseries Keywords:} lime milk, reactivity, titrimetric analysis, quality
control, impurities, calcium hydroxide, mine water treatment, heavy
metals, reagent efficiency.

способности известкового молока, используемого в качестве основного
реагента при очистке шахтных вод от ионов тяжёлых металлов. Проведено
сравнение четырёх титриметрических методик, различающихся условиями
пробоподготовки (растирание, кипячение), массой навески и применением
корректирующих коэффициентов. Показано, что средние значения реакционной
способности известкового молока составляют 38,2-45,7 \%, а среднее
значение по совокупности экспериментов - 42,9 \%. Установлено, что
полученные результаты существенно ниже нормативного диапазона (52--70
\%), регламентированного для данного реагента. Выявлено, что наиболее
воспроизводимые результаты даёт методика с использованием двух навесок и
предварительным растиранием пробы. Низкие значения активности
объясняются наличием примесей (Mg, Si, Al, Fe, гипс, песок), снижающих

{\bfseries Introduction.} The contamination of mine water with heavy metals
and acidic compounds is one of the most serious environmental challenges
faced by mining regions. According to {[}1, 2{]}, the discharge of
insufficiently treated mine water into surface water bodies leads to
elevated concentrations of copper, zinc, manganese, and iron ions, as
well as an increase in sulfate load. This contributes to the disruption
of ecosystem processes, the accumulation of toxic compounds in bottom
sediments, and the degradation of drinking water quality in nearby areas
{[}3{]}.

Estimates from the International Energy Agency indicate that the global
annual volume of mine water requiring treatment exceeds 10 billion cubic
meters, with a significant portion attributed to coal and non-ferrous
metal industries {[}4{]}. In countries with a highly developed mining
sector - such as China, Australia, the United States, and South Africa-
mine water treatment is a mandatory requirement for industrial mine
operation {[}5{]}.

In the literature, various alternative reagents for mine water treatment
are widely discussed, including strong oxidizing agents and
polymer-based flocculants. For example, the oxidizing reagent
``Fernel,'' based on potassium ferrate (K₂FeO₄, 25.2-40.3 wt.\%) and
alkali (KOH, 47.2-68.1 wt.\%), demonstrates high oxidative capacity and
is used for the removal of heavy metals from industrial wastewater
{[}6{]}. Studies also indicate that ferrate(VI) (FeO₄²⁻) can effectively
oxidize contaminants, resulting in the formation of stable Fe(III)
precipitates {[}7, 8{]}. However, despite its strong oxidizing
reactivity, the use of ferrate is often limited by high costs and
challenges associated with large-scale industrial application.

At the same time, the use of alkaline neutralizing reagents remains a
fundamental method in industrial practice. For instance, several authors
{[}9{]} have demonstrated the efficiency of alkaline neutralization
using calcium hydroxide under high concentrations of Fe and Mn in mine
waters.

In addition, industrial practice frequently involves the combined use of
reagents. In a pilot-scale mine water treatment facility at a
non-ferrous metal mining site, lime, a coagulant, and a polymer
flocculant were used simultaneously, which enabled the optimized
precipitation of heavy metals into the sludge phase {[}10{]}.

Thus, although reagents such as ferrate or polymeric flocculants
demonstrate good treatment performance, among the available purification
technologies, alkaline-based neutralization processes remain the most
effective and economically feasible {[}11, 12{]}, which is particularly
important for the long-term operation of treatment facilities {[}13{]}.

Lime milk - a water-based suspension of calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)₂ - is
commonly used to adjust pH and precipitate heavy metal hydroxides
{[}14,15{]}. Global practice shows that lime milk continues to be a
cost-effective reagent for both large-scale treatment plants and
localized systems at industrial facilities {[}16-18{]}.

The effectiveness of lime milk depends primarily on its reactivity,
i.e., the content of chemically available calcium hydroxide {[}19,
20{]}. Technological regulations typically specify that lime milk
reactivity should fall within the range of 52-70\%, although actual
values are often lower {[}21{]}. This discrepancy is generally
attributed to the quality of the initial lime, the presence of
impurities (Mg, Si, Al, Fe, gypsum, sand), and the conditions under
which the suspension is prepared.

In industrial settings, quality control of lime milk at treatment
facilities and production sites is typically performed using standard
titrimetric methods {[}22{]}. These methods are relatively simple,
cost-effective, and suitable for routine use in on-site laboratories.
However, the reproducibility of results and the selection of titration
parameters-such as sample mass, sample preparation, and temperature -
are often critical factors that influence the accuracy of reactivity
assessment. In many cases, deviations from the normative reactivity
range remain undetected, leading to reagent dosing errors and a
subsequent reduction in mine water treatment efficiency.

Inaccurate assessment of lime milk reactivity can cause two types of
problems. In the case of under-dosing, water remains contaminated with
heavy metals and acids. On the other hand, excessive dosing results in
so-called secondary pollution: elevated calcium ion concentrations,
increased pH levels, and excessive formation of precipitates (calcium
carbonates and sulfates) in the treated water. This complicates the
operation of treatment facilities and may have negative impacts on
receiving water bodies {[}23{]}.

Therefore, the accurate determination of lime milk reactivity and the
selection of an appropriate analytical method are essential for
environmentally safe and economically efficient mine water treatment.

The objective of this study is to compare various titrimetric methods
for determining lime milk reactivity, to identify factors influencing
the accuracy and reproducibility of results, and to assess the practical
implications of reagent reactivity variations for mine water treatment
processes.

{\bfseries Materials and methods.} The object of this study was actual
samples of lime milk used at the mine water treatment facilities of the
Belousovsky mine for the precipitation of heavy non-ferrous metal salts.
Lime milk is prepared in a mechanical classifier by slaking quicklime
with process water to obtain a 5\% Ca(OH)₂ suspension. Depending on the
quality of the initial lime -characterized by the content of active
component (52-70\%) the daily reagent consumption ranges from 0.34 to
0.46 tons, with a suspension density of approximately 1.03 g/cm³.

Since the lime milk suspension is in a constant state of solid phase
sedimentation, the samples were thoroughly mixed prior to sampling.
Analyses were performed using various methods, with the sample mass
being no less than 2 g. This is because smaller sample masses tend to
overestimate the amount of free lime and, consequently, the calculated
reactivity of the lime milk. The determination of free lime content was
carried out by titration. Titration was performed slowly, as rapid
addition of the titrant causes the rate of Ca(OH)₂ neutralization to
exceed its dissolution rate. This leads to partial reaction of the acid
with unreacted or overburnt lime particles. As a result, the measured
free lime content may be overestimated, and the calculated reactivity of
the lime milk may increase by 6-8\%.

In this study, 1 N solutions of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide
were used, prepared from fixanal standards immediately before analysis.
To ensure the reliability of the results and to eliminate random and
gross errors, each sample of lime milk of the same quality used in the
treatment of mine water at the Belousovsky mine was analyzed using
several basic methods {[}24,25{]}. This approach is justified by the
fact that existing methods for determining free and total lime content
are largely subjective, and even when analyzing the same sample,
discrepancies in calculated reactivity may reach 3-5\% or more.

\emph{{\bfseries Method Using Two Sample Masses (with Grinding and
Boiling)}}

To determine the free lime content (A\_free), approximately 5 g of
well-mixed lime milk was weighed on an analytical balance into a
porcelain mortar. A few drops of phenolphthalein were added, and the
sample was titrated with a 1 N solution of hydrochloric acid while
thoroughly grinding the lime particles with a pestle until complete and
stable decolorization was achieved. The titration was carried out
slowly. The free lime content (\%) as \emph{CaO} relative to the mass of
the lime milk was calculated using the following formula:

\(A_{free} = \frac{V_{HCl} \bullet 0,028 \bullet 100}{a}\) (1)

where: \(V_{HCl}\) - volume of 1N hydrochloric acid solution used for
titration, in cm³; 0.028 - the titer of 1 N \emph{HCl} solution with
respect to \emph{CaO} (g/cm³); a - sample mass of lime milk used for the
determination of free lime, in grams.

To determine the total lime content (\emph{A\tsb{total}}),
approximately 5 g of lime milk was placed into a 150 cm³ conical flask.
Then, 50 cm³ of 1 N hydrochloric acid solution was added, the flask was
covered with a watch glass, and the mixture was boiled for 1-2 minutes.
After cooling, the solution was titrated with 1 N sodium hydroxide
solution using methyl orange as an indicator, until the color changed
from red to yellow. The total lime content (\%) as \emph{CaO} relative
to the mass of the lime milk was calculated using the following formula:

\({\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ A}_{total} = \frac{{(50 - V}_{NaOH}) \bullet 0,028 \bullet 100}{b}\)
(2)

where: \(V_{NaOH}\)- volume of 1 N sodium hydroxide solution used for
titration, in cm³; b - sample mass of lime milk used for the
determination of total lime, in grams.

The reactivity (A\tsb{reactivity}) of the lime milk, expressed
as a percentage, was calculated using the formula:

\(\ \ \) \(Аactivity = \ \frac{A_{free}}{A_{total}} \bullet 100\) (3)

\emph{{\bfseries Method Using a Single Sample Mass (with Grinding and
Boiling)}}

To determine the free lime content, approximately 5 g of well-mixed lime
milk was weighed on an analytical balance into a porcelain mortar. A few
drops of phenolphthalein were added, and the sample was titrated with a
1 N hydrochloric acid solution while thoroughly grinding the lime
particles with a pestle until complete and stable decolorization was
achieved. The titration was performed slowly. The free lime content (\%)
as \emph{CaO} relative to the mass of the lime milk was calculated using
formula (1). To determine the total lime content, the contents of the
mortar were transferred to a 250 cm³ flask. The pestle and mortar were
rinsed with distilled water, which was also poured into the flask. Then,
50 cm³ of 1 N hydrochloric acid solution was added, the flask was
covered with a watch glass, and the mixture was boiled for 1-2 minutes.
After cooling, titration was carried out with a 1 N sodium hydroxide
solution using methyl orange as an indicator until the color changed
from red to yellow. The total lime content (\%) as \emph{CaO} relative
to the mass of the lime milk was calculated by the formula:

\(A_{total} = \frac{\left\lbrack {(V}_{HCl}\  + 50 \right) - V_{NaOH}\rbrack\  \bullet 0,028 \bullet 100}{a}\)
(4)

where: \(V_{HCl}\) - volume of 1 N hydrochloric acid solution used for
titration during the free lime determination, in cm³; 50 -volume of 1 N
hydrochloric acid solution added for the total lime determination, in
cm³; \(V_{NaOH}\) - volume of 1 N sodium hydroxide solution used for
titration during the total lime determination, in cm³; a - sample mass
of lime milk, in grams.

The reactivity (A\tsb{reactivity}) of the lime milk, expressed
as a percentage, was calculated using the formula:

\(Аactivity = \ \frac{V_{HCl}}{({(V}_{HCl}\  + 50) - V_{NaOH})} \bullet 100\)
(5)

\emph{{\bfseries Method Using a Single Sample Mass with Correction
Coefficient Determination (with Grinding, without Boiling)}}

Before starting the analysis, correction coefficients for the
hydrochloric acid solution (\(K_{HCl}\)) and sodium hydroxide solution
(\(K_{NaOH}\)). were determined. To determine the correction coefficient
for the 1 N HCl solution based on anhydrous sodium carbonate, anhydrous
sodium carbonate was dried in a drying oven for 1 hour at 250-270°C
using a reagent-grade sample. The 1N hydrochloric acid solution was
prepared by diluting the corresponding concentrated acid. To prepare 1
dm³ of 1 N HCl solution, 90 cm³ of acid with a density of ρ = 1.174
g/cm³ was carefully poured into water with stirring, and the volume was
then brought up to 1 dm³ with water. A weighed portion of anhydrous
sodium carbonate was placed into a conical flask, 40 cm³ of water was
added, followed by 3-4 drops of methyl orange indicator. The solution
was titrated from a burette with 1 N hydrochloric acid solution. Then,
the solution was heated and boiled for 2-3 minutes to remove carbon
dioxide, and after cooling, the titration was continued until the
reappearance of the color change. Three parallel experiments were
conducted, and the average volume of hydrochloric acid consumed during
titration was determined (Table 1). The correction coefficient
(\emph{K}) was calculated using the formula:

\(K_{HCl} = \frac{m_{1} \bullet 1000}{M_{1} \bullet C_{1} \bullet V_{ср}(HCl)}\)
(6)

where: m₁ - mass of the sodium carbonate sample; in grams; \emph{M₁} -
molar mass of the equivalent of the standard substance, 53.00 g/mol;
\emph{C₁} - nominal molar concentration of the substance in the
solution, mol/dm³; \(V_{ср}(HCl)\)~- average volume of the analyzed
hydrochloric acid solution consumed for titration, in cm³.

To determine the correction coefficient of the 1 N sodium hydroxide
solution using oxalic acid, 2 g of oxalic acid was weighed and placed
into a conical flask, dissolved in 50.0 cm³ of carbon dioxide-free
water, and heated to 60-70 °C. The contents of the flask were titrated
while hot with sodium hydroxide solution in the presence of 2 drops of
phenolphthalein until a persistent pink color appeared that did not fade
for 50--60 seconds. The correction coefficient (K) of the sodium
hydroxide solution was calculated using the formula (Table 2):

\(K = \frac{m}{V \bullet a}\) (7)

where: V - volume of sodium hydroxide solution consumed in titration,
cm³; m - mass of the standard substance, g; a - mass of the standard
substance equivalent to 1 ml of sodium hydroxide solution with
concentration C(NaOH) = 1 mol/dm³, a = 0.06304 g for oxalic acid.

For the determination of free lime, approximately 5 g of well-mixed lime
milk was weighed on technical scales in a porcelain mortar. A few drops
of phenolphthalein were added, and the sample was titrated with 1 N
hydrochloric acid solution while carefully grinding the lime particles
with a pestle until complete and stable decolorization was achieved.
Titration was carried out slowly. The content of free lime (\%)
\emph{CaO} relative to the mass of lime milk was calculated using the
formula:

\(A_{free} = \frac{V_{HCl} \bullet K_{HCl} \bullet 0,028 \bullet 100}{a}\)
(8)

where: \(V_{HCl}\) is the volume of 1 N hydrochloric acid solution used
for titration, cm³; \emph{K\tsb{HCl}} is the
correction coefficient for the 1 N hydrochloric acid solution; 0.028 is
the titer of 1 N hydrochloric acid solution in terms of \emph{CaO}; and
\emph{a} is the lime milk sample mass taken for free lime determination,
g.

For the determination of total lime, the contents of the mortar were
transferred to a 250 cm³ flask. The pestle and mortar were rinsed with
distilled water, which was also poured into the flask. Then 50 cm³ of 1
N hydrochloric acid solution was added, and the mixture was titrated
with 1 N sodium hydroxide solution using methyl orange as an indicator
until the red color changed to yellow. The total lime content (\%)
\emph{CaO} relative to the mass of lime milk was calculated by the
formula:

\(A_{total} = \frac{\left\lbrack {(V}_{HCl}\  + 50 \right) \bullet K_{HCl} - V_{NaOH} \bullet K_{NaOH}\rbrack\  \bullet 0,028 \bullet 100}{a}\)
(9)

where: \(V_{HCl}\)- is the volume of 1 N hydrochloric acid solution used
in the free lime titration, cm³; \emph{K\tsb{HCl}} - is the
correction coefficient for hydrochloric acid; 50 cm³ is the volume of 1
N hydrochloric acid added for total lime determination; \(V_{NaOH}\) -
is the volume of 1 N sodium hydroxide solution used in the total lime
titration, cm³; \(K_{NaOH}\) - is the correction coefficient for sodium
hydroxide; \(a\) -- and a is the lime milk sample mass, g.

The reactivity (A\tsb{reactivity}) of the lime milk (\%) was
calculated using the formula:

\(Аactivity = \ \frac{V_{HCl} \bullet K_{HCl}}{\left\lbrack {(V}_{HCl}\  + 50 \right) \bullet K_{HCl} - V_{NaOH} \bullet K_{NaOH}\rbrack} \bullet 100\)
(10)

\emph{{\bfseries Method with a single sample and determination of

lime milk mass was calculated using formula (9). Lime milk reactivity
(\%) was calculated using formula (10).

{\bfseries Results and discussion.} During the study, several methods for
determining the reactivity of lime milk were tested. These methods
differed in terms of accuracy, labor intensity, and suitability for use
under industrial conditions. In real-world practice at treatment
facilities, the choice of analytical method is guided by the need to
balance data reliability with operational efficiency.

To assess the reactivity of lime milk, a series of experiments was
conducted using the double-sample method and various indicators
(phenolphthalein and methyl orange). This approach allowed for
simultaneous determination of both free and total lime content, thus
making the results more reliable. In each experiment, the amounts of
free and total lime were determined, on the basis of which the active
portion of the reagent was calculated. The experimental results are
presented in Table 3.

As shown in Table 1, the reactivity of lime milk in the analyzed samples
ranged from 41.04\% to 48.62\%, with an average value of 45.74\%.
Statistical analysis revealed that the range of values was 7.58\%, the
standard deviation was 4.10\%, and the coefficient of variation amounted
to 8.97\%. This variability indicates the influence of suspension
heterogeneity and the specifics of the titration process.

Overall, the method demonstrated sufficiently high accuracy and
reproducibility. However, the analysis requires more time and reagents,
making it less convenient for repeated determinations under real-world
conditions at operating treatment facilities.

To optimize the quality control procedure, a single-sample method was
tested, which allows the analysis time to be reduced by nearly half. The
experimental results obtained using this method are presented in Table

The reactivity of the lime milk in the analyzed samples varied from
31.71\% to 54.55\%. The average reactivity value was 45.42\%.
Statistical analysis revealed a range of values of 22.84\%, a standard
deviation (σ) of 11.85\%, and a coefficient of variation (V) of 26.1\%.
Thus, the single-sample method demonstrated a significant scatter of
results, exceeding acceptable limits for analytical measurements.

To improve the accuracy of lime milk reactivity determination, a
single-sample method with the application of correction coefficients was
used, with samples analyzed without boiling. The use of correction
coefficients helps to account for possible deviations in titrant volumes
and thereby increases the reliability of the obtained results. The
experimental data are presented in Table 5.

The reactivity of lime milk determined by this method ranged from

significantly lower than the expected regulatory standards. Statistical
analysis revealed considerable data variability: the standard deviation
was 5.02\%, and the coefficient of variation reached 11.9\%, indicating
low reproducibility of the method.

For further analysis, a method with a single sample weight was applied,
using correction coefficients, but the samples were analyzed without
boiling and without grinding the lime milk. The absence of grinding may
additionally affect the completeness of calcium hydroxide dissolution,
which impacts the accuracy of the results (Table 6).

The reactivity of lime milk by this method ranged from 32.89\% to

expected regulatory standards. The range of values was 16.32\%, the

To assess the accuracy and reproducibility, the results obtained by all
four titration methods were compared. Table 7 presents the average

The two-sample method allows for the separate determination of free and
total lime content, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the
composition of lime milk. In the conducted experiments (Table 7), the
reagent reactivity ranged from 41.04\% to 48.62\%, with an average value
of 45.74 ± 4.10\%. Using two samples yields more reliable results
compared to methods utilizing a single sample, as it accounts for both
the dissolved and the precipitated parts of calcium hydroxide. However,
the method remains quite sensitive to the conditions of the analysis:
the results are influenced by the sample mass and the titration rate.
Thus, the two-sample method provides the highest accuracy and is used as
the primary control technique for adjusting reagent consumption in
accordance with the technological regulations.

The single-sample method is a simplified version of the analysis used
for operational production control. It allows for halving the analysis
time, which is especially important when multiple determinations are
required during a shift. However, the obtained results showed extremely
high variability - the coefficient of variation was 26.1\%, indicating
low reproducibility of the method. The large scatter is explained by
several factors: heterogeneity of the lime milk suspension, errors in
weighing the sample, as well as differences in the dissolution and
neutralization rates of calcium hydroxide during titration. Thus, the
single-sample method is convenient and sufficiently reliable for rapid
assessment of lime milk reactivity, but it does not provide the
necessary accuracy and reliability for regular analytical control.

The application of the single-sample method with the use of a correction
factor represents a modification of the accelerated method, which takes
into account adjustments for systematic titration errors. This
simplifies the analysis procedure while simultaneously improving the
accuracy of titrant volume measurement. However, the obtained results
showed a significant variability in reactivity values (ranging from
36.08\% to 49.44\%). The average value was 42.23\%, which is noticeably
below the standard level. A coefficient of variation of 11.9\% indicates
relatively low reproducibility of the method. Despite the use of
correction factors, the influence of factors such as suspension
heterogeneity, titration speed, and differences in lime component
solubility remains. Thus, the single-sample method without boiling, even
with the use of a correction factor, provides only an approximate
estimation of lime milk reactivity and cannot be considered a
sufficiently reliable control method for the operation of treatment
facilities.

The application of the single-sample method without boiling and without
grinding revealed an even wider range of lime milk reactivity values
compared to previous approaches. The average value was low (38.20\%),
and the variability between individual measurements was significant.
Statistical indicators confirm the low reproducibility of the method:
the coefficient of variation was 14.7\%, which substantially exceeds the
acceptable limits for analytical determinations. A key factor affecting
the results is the absence of grinding the sample, which limits the
completeness of calcium hydroxide dissolution and leads to an
underestimation of reactivity. Although some high values were recorded
(up to 49.21\%), they did not compensate for the overall downward trend
in average values. Thus, despite its simplicity, this method proved to
be the least reliable among the investigated techniques and can only be
used as a rough express analysis rather than for regular production
control.

A comparative analysis of the obtained data showed that the highest
reproducibility was achieved by the two-sample method: the coefficient
of variation was less than 10\%, which falls within acceptable limits
for analytical measurements. This method also demonstrated the smallest
range of values (41.04-48.62\%). The single-sample method proved to be
the least reliable, with a coefficient of variation reaching 26.1\% and
a value range exceeding 22\%. This indicates a high sensitivity of the
method to the analysis conditions, making it unsuitable for precise
control. The use of correction factors partially improved
reproducibility (standard deviation decreased to 5.02--5.62\%), but the
omission of boiling and grinding the samples negatively affected the
completeness of active component dissolution, leading to an
underestimation of average reactivity values (38.20-42.23\%).

{\bfseries Conclusions.} The analysis of the obtained data (Table 7) showed
that the reactivity of 5\% lime milk used at the mine water treatment
facilities of the Belousovsky mine for the precipitation of heavy metal
salts averages 42.9\%, which is significantly lower than the values
specified in the technological regulations (52-70\%). This discrepancy
requires continuous monitoring of the actual lime consumption and
adjustment of the daily reagent dosage.

The reasons for the reduced reactivity are related both to the
composition of the raw material and to the technological conditions of
its processing. Unsaturated lime produced by the calcination of
calcium-magnesium rocks is used to prepare the lime milk. Besides pure
calcium and magnesium oxides, the calcined product contains compounds
with silicon, aluminum, and iron, as well as underburnt residues. These
impurities reduce the rereactivity of the lime, and its instability in
air additionally leads to partial carbonation.

The effectiveness of lime milk depends on the solubility and dissolution
rate of calcium hydroxide, which are influenced by temperature, crystal
structure, impurity content, and slaking conditions. The actual
reactivity was insufficient to ensure the normative pH level of 10.5 at
the standard dosage, which may reduce the efficiency of the treatment
process.

The conducted research demonstrated that the titration conditions
significantly affect the reactivity analysis results. Key factors
include the titration rate, the necessity of grinding the sample, the
use of boiling for determining total lime content, the quality of
prepared titrant solutions, and the presence of foreign components
(gypsum, sand, aluminum and iron oxides, magnesium hydroxide).

Comparison of titration methods showed that simplified approaches
(single sample, with correction factors) produce substantially higher
variability and lower reproducibility. The two-sample method provides
the highest accuracy and stability of results, ensuring reliable quality
control of lime milk under production conditions.

Thus, the following conclusions can be drawn from the results:

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}

1. The actual reactivity of lime milk is below normative values and
requires adjustment of reagent consumption.

2. The decrease in reactivity is related to the quality of the initial
lime, its structure, and impurity content.

3. Analysis results depend on the titration methodology.

4. For production control, the two-sample method is recommended as the
most accurate and reproducible.

At the same time, in the practice of the Belousovsky mine's treatment
facilities, it is advisable to establish a lime milk reactivity control
system based on the following principle: regular laboratory control
using the two-sample method; operational control during shifts using the
single-sample method or with correction factors; express control at the
preparation site using the single-sample method without boiling and
grinding. This approach provides a balance between analytical accuracy
and ease of application in production conditions.
