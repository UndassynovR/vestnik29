{\bfseries Introduction.} The impact of technology on the tourism industry
is important in today's rapidly changing environment. As digitalization
becomes more widespread, the number of traditional travel agencies is
decreasing, and the number of online travel agencies (OTA) is
increasing. This change not only affects economic relations within the
industry, but also highlights the need to adapt to technological
advances in order to remain competitive. In addition, the rapid
development of technology, including mobile apps, websites and social
media, is changing the way consumers interact with travel services and
make travel decisions. It is extremely important for enterprises to
actively implement information technology (IT) to improve the quality of
service and meet the changing expectations of consumers.

The main types of digital transformation that are actively used today in
the tourism market of the Republic of Kazakhstan:

1. Online booking;

2. Mobile applications;

3. Big Data Analytics;

4. Artificial intelligence and chatbots;

5. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems;

6. Blockchain technologies;

7. Internet of Things (IoT);

8. Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR).

Research aimed at understanding the impact of technology on the tourism
industry and offering new solutions is needed to inform practice and
bring positive changes to the sector. These changes not only affect
economic relations within the industry, but also highlight the need to
adapt to technological advances in order to remain competitive. In this
study, our goal was to show how the integration of digital solutions
into the management of travel services can significantly improve the
quality and efficiency of services provided. It is aimed at
understanding the impact of digital transformation on the tourism
industry and offering new solutions necessary to inform practice and
make positive changes in the tourism industry of Kazakhstan.

{\bfseries Literature review.} In recent years, open sources have provided
sufficient data on the results of targeted studies of digital
transformation in the tourism industry by both foreign and Kazakhstani
researchers.

The McKinsey report "The Future of Tourism" (2024) outlines how the
development of digital technologies has led to new ways to increase
customer satisfaction and optimize travel services {[}1{]}.

The Travelport Digital Traveler Survey (2019) highlights the role of
mobile apps in travel. The study shows that travelers are increasingly
relying on mobile apps to book, communicate and receive real-time
updates, making them essential tools for improving the quality of
service in the travel industry. This trend is especially noticeable in
emerging markets such as Kazakhstan, where mobile applications have
become an integral part for both tourists and businesses {[}2{]}. The
data provided by Statista (2023) also reflects the growing trend in the
use of mobile applications and digital platforms in the tourism sector.
This digital shift in consumer behavior is also observed in Kazakhstan,
where the number of downloaded travel and tourism applications has
increased dramatically, which indicates the importance of mobile
solutions in the tourism market {[}3{]}.

The study by A. Abuev, analyst at Freedom Finance Global, on tourism in
Kazakhstan contains a comprehensive analysis of the problems and
opportunities of the industry (2024) {[}4{]}. In addition, the "Concept
for the development of the tourism sector of Kazakhstan for 2023-2029"
emphasizes the government' s commitment to stimulating
innovation and improving the ecosystem of digital tourism {[}5{]}.

In their works on the ecosystem of digital tourism in Kazakhstan,
D.G.Mamraeva and L.V.Tashenova, Borbasova Z.N., Grebenyuk D.D. explore
how innovative digital solutions increase business efficiency in the
sector. This, in turn, gave them the opportunity, based on existing
digital solutions in the tourism market of Kazakhstan, to present its
unified digital ecosystem. The authors also provide examples of
implemented "smart technologies" in tourism in Kazakhstan {[}6{]}.

It is shown how the introduction of digital tools, such as contactless
payment systems and online booking platforms, transforms the operational
side of travel services {[}7{]}. Their research points to the success of
platforms such as eQonaq, which registered a significant number of
tourists in 2023-2024, demonstrating a growing dependence on digital
infrastructure to manage tourist flows {[}8{]}.

Kazakhstan' s civil aviation sector is also benefiting
from the transition to digital technologies. Kalekeeva M. et al. (2024)
based on data from the Civil Aviation Committee, they indicate an
increase in passenger traffic at airports in the period from 2019 to
2023, which once again emphasizes the role of digital platforms in
managing large flows of tourists and improving the quality of service at
key transit points {[}9{]}.

In conclusion, it should be noted that, judging by the volume and
intensity of publication in various sources, the integration of digital
solutions into the management of tourist services has significantly
improved the quality and efficiency of the services provided. The future
of tourism in the digital economy, as noted in most of them, is likely
to continue to be determined by these technological advances, which will
further improve the quality of services provided and the economic growth
of the industry.

{\bfseries Materials and Methods.} The accepted research method consists of
analyzing quantitative and qualitative market data, as well as observing
the main actual trends in a comparative perspective.

The following methods were used in the course of the study: monographic,
economic and statistical, analytical, comparative. The article uses
general scientific methods, in particular the method of content
analysis, which allowed analyzing an array of information from
theoretical approaches to digitalization and digital technologies in
tourism to digital platforms and specialized programs for the
development of tourist routes, as well as the method of graphical
interpretation. The article clearly presents examples and directions of
the use of digital technologies in the tourism industry, in particular
BigData, AR/VR, Blockchain, IoT, portals for the development of tourist
routes, mobile applications. Further, it analyzes how the tourism sector
has changed under the influence of digitalization, highlights the main
trends, concludes about the difficulties and directions of
digitalization, highlights promising digital technologies of the tourism
business, and summarizes the main ideas of the study.

{\bfseries Results and Discussions.} The tourism sector is, first of all,
one of the fastest growing industries in the world. The development of
technology encourages travel destinations and the hospitality industry
to optimize business development decisions and improve the quality of
travel services. It is so widespread that, according to a Google Travel
study, 74\% of vacationers plan their trips using the Internet, while
only 13\% still use travel services to organize them {[}6{]}. Thanks to
the use of mobile applications, contactless payment systems and
data-based analytical information, the tourism sector is better adapted
to meet the changing needs of modern travelers, which is evident both
from global trends and from the specifics of Kazakhstan. Technology has
helped to reduce costs, improve operational efficiency, and improve
customer offerings and understanding. Thanks to this, both travelers and
businessmen can benefit from advanced communication, booking and visitor
service systems.

The operational effectiveness of digitalization processes in tourism can
be highlighted through several key aspects:

\emph{1. Automation of processes:}

- cost reduction: automation of routine tasks such as booking and
inventory management, etc.;

- fcceleration of processing: fast processing of requests and payments.

\emph{2. Supply chain optimization:}

- system integration: using digital platforms to integrate various
service providers (hotels, airlines, etc.);

- inventory management: optimal resource management.

\emph{3. Data analysis and business intelligence:}

- informed decision-making: using analytics to assess consumer behavior
and market trends;

- increased flexibility: quick access to data.

\emph{4. Personalization of services:}

- increase customer loyalty;

- marketing optimization: improving the effectiveness of marketing
campaigns.

\emph{5. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems}:

- improved interaction: made it possible to effectively manage customer
contacts and track their preferences;

- reduced staff turnover.

\emph{6. Mobile technologies:}

- accessibility of information: Mobile applications provide information
to customers (anytime, anywhere);

- increased sales: convenience of mobile booking.

\emph{7. Innovations and new technologies:}

- adaptation to the market: introduction of new technologies (for
example, artificial intelligence, blockchain);

- risk reduction: the use of technologies to monitor and manage risks
(for example, related to data security).

The next technology is apps, especially mobile travel apps, which have
made booking and other travel-related tasks much easier by changing the
way people plan and receive their travel experiences. Tourists rely on
mobile apps to address issues such as language barriers, cultural
differences, and isolation while traveling. Considering that in 2019,
more than one billion users of mobile travel applications, approximately
1.5 billion people traveled and about 65\% of them used smartphones to
book, the impact of these applications on tourism is undeniable {[}8{]}.

More than 60\% of users use mobile travel apps when planning their
trips, which makes it easier and more convenient. Between 2023 and 2024,
the most downloaded travel apps in the world, based on the cumulative
number of downloads (in millions) on the part of Statista, they
demonstrate the diverse needs of travelers around the world. So, Google
Maps is in the lead with 113 million downloads, followed by Uber with
107, Booking.com With 80, Airbnb with 52 million downloads, followed by
Google Earth and Where is My Train reaching 51 and 46 million downloads
respectively. The figures reflect the widespread use of travel
applications in various aspects of travel, from navigation to
accommodation and transportation (Figure 1).

In terms of market share in both the US and Europe, Uber retained a
significant market share in 2023: 10\% in the USA and 18\% in Europe.
Booking.com It dominates the US market with a market share of 7\% and
14\% in Europe, demonstrating its popularity as a housing booking
platform. In addition, Airbnb has a significant market share in both
regions: 6\% in the United States and 7\% in Europe. Other notable
players include Vrbo and Expedia in the United States, as well as Bolt
and Ryanair in Europe, each contributing to the comprehensive travel
industry (Figure 2).

In the digital age, artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to have a
huge impact on all industries, including, especially, tourism. AI has
significantly changed the approaches to travel planning and organization
around the world: from personalizing travel to improving the management
of tourist destinations and optimizing customer service using advanced
technologies such as chatbots and recommendation systems. Artificial
intelligence algorithms allow you to analyze huge amounts of data - from
Internet searches and social media interactions, taking into account
previous travel options, to provide personalized recommendations on
places, events, hotels and restaurants that match the interests and
budget of the tourist.

Data as of 2023 indicate a high level of confidence among travelers
around the world in using AI for various aspects of travel planning in
2033. The first place in the list is occupied by the placement: 75\% of
travelers expressed confidence in AI in this aspect, followed by
international transport agreements and local transport (74\% each).
Other aspects, as can be seen from Figure 4, are also highly trusted by
travelers (Figure 3).

As technology evolves, we can expect AI to play an increasingly
important role in the growth and change of tourism around the world,
changing how customers perceive and interact with the world while
traveling.

Returning to the expectations of the future use of technology in the
tourism industry, the following is an analysis of the data obtained from
statista.com , regarding the proportion of travelers who plan to use
selected travel planning tools in 2033 worldwide as of 2022. It is
assumed that among these tools, applications that include all the
necessary functions for travel planning will be most often used (52\% of
travelers express their intention to use them) (Figure 4).

{\bfseries Fig.4 -The proportion of travelers planning to use selected
travel planning tools in 2033 worldwide as of 2022}

\emph{Note: Complied by the authors based on the official website of the
Statista {[}3{]}}

Figure 4 above shows that pre-virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality
(AR) tours will also start to attract attention: 51\% and 45\% of
travelers, respectively, expressed their desire to use their immersive
trip planning technologies, giving them a realistic view of the trip and
helping them make decisions.

Online travel agencies (OTA) and price comparison websites are expected
to remain popular planning tools in 2033: 44\% of tourists plan to use
them to prepare for a trip. Social media reviews are expected to
influence travel planning decisions: 42\% of travelers expect to rely on
them when planning a trip. To summarize, an analysis of the current use
of technology in the tourism industry reveals a variety of planning
tools and platforms that adapt to the changing needs and preferences of
travelers. These technologies help to personalize travel experiences,
optimize booking processes and provide valuable information and
recommendations.

Facebook Instagramming the role of social media as another aspect of
technological advances in the tourism industry in the Republic of
Kazakhstan and their impact, various platforms such as Facebook,
Instagram and YouTube have begun to play an important role in shaping
the perception and choice of travelers. Blogs in both text and video
formats are becoming increasingly interesting {[}8{]}. Significant
problems have been identified that negatively affect the development of
tourism. Such factors include: fraud, distortion of reality, the
credibility of the opinion of media personalities, uneven coverage of
age groups of tourists.

Personal impressions of tourists play a significant role in choosing a
vacation destination: reviews, photos and other content generated on the
Internet (Table 1). When preparing for a trip, most respondents pay
attention to social networks (53.8\%) and reviews from relatives,
friends and acquaintances (48.6\%). Reviews on the Internet are viewed
by 35.5\% of respondents, and the websites of tour operators are viewed
by 22.1\% {[}10{]}. It is possible to highlight the high popularity of
social networks among respondents aged 25 to 34 years (62.4\%).
Respondents over the age of 35 are much more likely than others to rely
on feedback from relatives, friends and acquaintances (35-55 years old
-- 56.7\%, over 55 years old -- 70.8\%). Young people mentioned the
tourist portals of local authorities much more often than others
(22.4\%) (Table 1).

The transition to the use of mobile applications and the analysis of
popular types of travel applications in Kazakhstan provides valuable
information about the role of technology in the development of tourism
in the country {[}3{]}. In Kazakhstan, as in many other countries, these
applications offer a wide range of functions, including booking tours
and tickets, navigation, currency conversion and access to information
about destinations in real time. Tourists can conveniently book flights,
accommodation, transportation and events using a single application,
eliminating the need to use multiple platforms or visit physical travel
agencies, saving time and energy {[}Tashenova L.V. et al., 2022{]}. The
transition to digitalization in the tourism sector also has significant
environmental benefits, as it reduces dependence on paper processes and
documentation.

The analysis of the most downloaded travel applications in Kazakhstan
provides important data on the preferences and practices of travelers in
the country {[}3{]}. Applications such as Yandex Navigator, Aviata.kz
and Booking.com They are among the most popular options for travelers,
offering a wide range of services from navigation and booking tickets to
booking accommodation. By adopting digital technologies and using the
capabilities of mobile technologies, Kazakhstan can strengthen its
position as a leading tourist destination and stimulate economic growth
in the country (Table 2).

It is noteworthy to emphasize the importance of e-commerce in Kazakhstan
and its significant role in the country' s tourism
sector. E-commerce, conducting business transactions electronically via
the Internet, has changed the way travel services are accessed and
provided.

Statistics show that a significant part of the services provided through
the market in Kazakhstan, about 50.3\%, relate to passenger
transportation services. This indicates a strong dependence on online
platforms for booking flights, trains and other modes of transport. With
the advent of e-commerce, customers no longer need to visit physical
offices or travel agents to make a reservation. Moreover, 9.6\% of
services include tickets and seat reservations on transport, which once
again highlights the role of e-commerce in facilitating travel
arrangements. E-commerce has also made it easier to book and pay for
accommodation services, accounting for 1.6\% of services provided
through a trading platform in Kazakhstan. This means the importance of
online platforms allowing travelers to book accommodation, from hotels
to vacation rentals, with ease and convenience. By offering a convenient
booking and payment process, e-commerce has contributed to improving the
overall quality of travel for tourists visiting Kazakhstan {[}12{]}.

Initiatives aimed at improving the technological infrastructure of the
tourism sector are growing in modern Kazakhstan. "Tourism Online"
includes a description of tourism projects implemented in Kazakhstan
(urban tourism development, caravanning, information tours, etc.), as
well as an interactive map of routes and attractions in the regions of
the country. An interesting innovative solution within the framework of
this module was the opening of the "Online Academy of Domestic Tourism"
{[}3{]}.

The Golden Horde project, which includes information and a map about the
main milestones and the territory of the Golden Horde, a calendar of
events, as well as the ability to choose a guide in the region to
receive high-quality sightseeing services.

The Photobank project: a Kazakhstani photo stock of the regions and
attractions of Kazakhstan; photos are available for download, but with a

Digital technologies are being introduced into the hotel business with
some lag, compared with industries such as finance and industry.
However, interest in the use of digital technologies in the activities
of hotel chains is very high, due to the initial customer orientation of
hotel companies. Digital tools allow you to "hear" the client, make him
the center of activity of hotel chains {[}12{]}.

Progress in the field of digital technologies provides companies with
the opportunity to use new resources, sales channels and tools, without
which the set goals will not be achieved. But the process of integrating
digital technologies into the operations of hotel companies is becoming
increasingly difficult, requiring significant financial resources and
qualified specialists. Leading hotel TNCs are implementing an ambitious
digital transformation aimed at bringing the customer back to the center
of their strategy and operations.

The digital tourism ecosystem of Kazakhstan presented above, its modules
and components are an innovative solution for the tourism business of
the country, individual regions, tourist destinations and all market
participants.

The intuitive interface of Google Maps makes it easier for guides to
accurately determine the location of visitors. Guides keep travelers
informed of their location, especially when they venture beyond the
500-meter border from them. This particular attribute serves to mitigate
any potential ambiguity regarding the tour schedule.

Thus, the most downloaded mobile travel apps in the world reflect
consumers'{} preferences for uninterrupted on-demand
services. The increased use of applications has contributed to the
improvement of the quality and accessibility of services, which has
further improved the user experience.

{\bfseries Conclusion.} The creation of a developed tourism sector is of
great importance as a key strategy for the structural transformation of
the economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan. This paper examines the
impact of technological improvements on the tourism business in
Kazakhstan, analyzes both the consequences and the growing difficulties
in this sector.

Strategic proposals for improvised technological use in the industry
have highlighted the importance of fully integrating digital
technologies into all elements of tourism and hospitality. Kazakhstan
should give priority to the rapid introduction of innovative products
and technologies in order to ensure a strong presence in the global
tourism business in a highly competitive environment. It is strongly
recommended to introduce new types of logistics using IT technologies
into the tourism industry. This includes the introduction of computer
technologies into hotel and airline reservation systems, the use of
innovative technologies to ensure tourist routes, ensure mobility and
safety of transport services. Technology has come to enhance the
traveler' s experience and facilitate many steps that in
previous years could have become difficult or tedious. This also makes
the tourism industry a promising option with high growth expectations,
which makes it attractive to investors who have noticed the interesting
evolution of this industry.

The digital transformation of the tourism sector includes various types
of technologies and approaches that affect operational efficiency and
customer service quality. They cover a variety of processes that
significantly change the way we interact with customers and manage
resources in the tourism sector:

\emph{1. Online booking and sale of services - Convenience for

price optimization. Analyzing consumer behavior data helps predict
seasonal fluctuations and adapt supply, improving operational

helps to improve the quality of services;

- improvement of reputation management. Online reputation management
becomes more effective by monitoring reviews.

\emph{7. Digital guides and mobile applications:}

- the interactivity of the Application with information about tourist
routes, restaurants and attractions increases the interest in travel;

- artificial intelligence and chatbots automate customer support. They
can quickly respond to customer requests 24/7, which improves the
quality of service and reduces the burden on staff;

- aI algorithms can analyze customer preferences and offer them
personalized recommendations and related services, increasing the
likelihood of purchases;

based on data.

\emph{9. Travel planning:}

- creates the possibility of combining and integrating various services
in one platform;

- virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR technologies) allow users to
"view" places and services in advance, i.e. conduct interactive tours,
which may affect their booking decision. These technologies can
enhance the "customer experience" of users and improve their
engagement, creating unique experiences, and become a tool for
creating individualized routes based on customer preferences.

Digitalization of the tourism sector not only improves the customer
experience, but also contributes to business efficiency, reducing costs
and increasing profits. The integration of technology into the tourism
business of the republic can significantly stimulate growth and promote
innovation. The results highlight the importance of continuous
technological improvement in order to keep up with global trends and
meet the growing expectations of modern visitors. Considering that
digital transformation includes various types of technologies and
approaches that affect operational efficiency and customer service
quality, an attempt has been made to present in an orderly manner those
processes that have significantly changed the way customers interact and
manage resources in the tourism sector.

Kazakhstan can use digital transformation to ensure a sustainable future
for its tourism industry by implementing strategic planning and
continuous adaptation. These activities are expected to enhance the
quality of service, operational efficiency and overall customer
satisfaction, which will ultimately contribute to the sustainable growth
of the tourism industry. This, in turn, will increase the
competitiveness and attractiveness of Kazakhstan as a global tourist
destination.
