{\bfseries Introduction.} In the conditions of modern food industry
increasing attention is paid to the development of functional meat
products using natural components with biologically active properties.
In this regard, promising directions are the inclusion in the
formulation of meat products of plant raw materials with antioxidant,
immunostimulating and antimicrobial activity. Such components include
acorus calamus rhizome, pumpkin seed cake, as well as a complex of humic
and fulvic acids.

Acorus calamus rhizome is a valuable source of biologically active
substances, including essential oils (α-asarone, β-asarone), phenolic
compounds and glycosides with pronounced antioxidant, antimicrobial and
anti-inflammatory activity. Studies by scientist Evdokimov and his
colleagues have shown that the addition of calamus extracts to meat
products helps to reduce microbial contamination and increase shelf life
by inhibiting lipid oxidation {[}1{]}. In addition, calamus components
have a positive effect on digestion by modulating intestinal microflora
and have a carminative effect.

Pumpkin seed cake (Cucurbita pepo L.) is a rich source of dietary fibre
(up to 15-20\%), proteins (about 30\%), polyunsaturated fatty acids,
especially linoleic acid, as well as tocopherols and phytosterols. It
also contains phenolic compounds with high antioxidant activity that
protect lipids from oxidation in meat matrices. A study by scientist
Leichtweis and colleagues showed that the use of pumpkin seed cake in
meat products helps to increase the overall antioxidant activity,
improve the texture and nutritional value of the product {[}2{]}. In
addition, it reduces the glycemic index and improves the lipid profile
of the final product.

Complex of humic and fulvic acids is a bioactive mixture of humic acids,
fulvic acids and humins. These substances have a high complexing
ability, binding metal ions and improving their bioavailability, which
contributes to the trace element enrichment of the meat product.
According to studies in recent years, the addition of humic-fulvic acids
to poultry diets or meat products contributes to a decrease in lipid
oxidation, an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes (catalase,
glutathione peroxidase) and a decrease in the activity of lipoxygenases
{[}3,4{]}.

In a study by Simakova and her colleagues, scientists emphasize that
humic substances can perform a preserving function, increasing the shelf
life of poultry meat without the addition of synthetic antioxidants
{[}5{]}. In the study of the scientist Mao, it was found to improve the
immune status of animals and increase meat productivity, which makes
humic-fulvic acids a promising additive for use in the technology of
functional meat products {[}6{]}.

The aim of the present work is to study the effect of humic-fulvic acid
complex and calamus rhizome on physicochemical and organoleptic
parameters of meat product.

{\bfseries Materials and methods.} For the investigation of the impact of
plant components on the quality attributes of meat products, horse
meat-based roll (roulade) samples were prepared at the Educational and
Scientific Center of Meat Processing of the Almaty Technological
University.

The following components of plant origin were purchased for the
experiment:

- calamus Rhizome - dried crushed raw material with a specific aroma and
bitter-spicy flavor;

- complex of humic and fulvic acids `T8 Tayga Stone' - a natural
concentrated product containing active humic and fulvic acids with
antioxidant properties;

- pumpkin seed cake is a secondary plant product after oil pressing,
characterized by a high content of dietary fibre, minerals and
antioxidants.

The selection of Acorus calamus rhizome and the complex of humic-fulvic
acids was based on their known functional properties, including the
potential ability to lower the pH and reduce the thiobarbituric acid
(TBA) value, thereby slowing lipid oxidation processes. Additionally,
the humic-fulvic acids were expected to contribute to meat tenderness by
modifying muscle tissue structure. Pumpkin seed cake was utilized to
enhance the sensory profile-specifically flavor and aroma-while
simultaneously acting as a barrier coating, thus reducing moisture loss
during thermal treatment.

For the study, horse meat was purchased from the local market, which was
visually characterised by signs of increased pH, which was confirmed by
organoleptic indicators (dark red colour, dry and hard surface and
reduced elasticity) indicating possible changes as a result of storage.
After acquisition, the meat was subjected to technological operations:
cutting, deboning. Next, the meat was cut into 200 g pieces with a
weight of about 1 cm thick and prepared for the wet salting process.

A brine base including 1.5 litres of water, 75 g table salt and 0.3 g
sodium nitrite was made to prepare the brine. Portions of meat were
placed in a specially purchased plastic dish (GN1/6
polypropylene/Schneider/Germany) and poured 100 ml of the prepared brine
base. Then, humic-fulvic acid complex and, previously brewed in hot
water and cooled to room temperature, calamus rhizome (100 ml) were
introduced into the brine. The amount of plant-based components was
calculated according to the experimental matrix as a percentage of the
meat weight (200 g). The total volume of brine for each sample was 200
ml.

The brining process was carried out at 2 ± 2°C and lasted 24 hours.

After completion of the salting process, the meat samples were removed
from the brine and further prepared for heat treatment. The pumpkin seed
cake was ground to powder using a nano-crusher (Grindomix GM 200,
Retsch, Germany) to obtain a homogeneous fine structure. Then, water was
gradually added to the obtained powder, mixing thoroughly until a
homogeneous paste-like consistency was achieved, which was convenient
for application to the surface of meat.

The obtained paste from pumpkin seeds evenly covered the surface of each
meat sample in the amount of 5\% of the weight of meat raw material,
after which the products were formed in the form of rolls. The prepared
rolls were hermetically wrapped in thin aluminium foil and placed in a
heat chamber (UK-3\textbackslash1M100, Techtron+, Russia). Heat
treatment was carried out at 110°C until the temperature in centre of
the roll reached 78°C, which was monitored using a thermometer with a
probe.

After completion of thermal treatment, the rolls were cooled to room
temperature (20±2°C) in air. Then the finished samples were placed in
storage at refrigerator temperature (2±2°C) until the organoleptic
evaluation and laboratory tests aimed at studying the effect of plant
components on the quality parameters of the meat product.

Laboratory analyses of the final products were conducted at the
accredited testing laboratory ``Food Safety'' of Almaty Technological
University (Certificate accreditation No.KZ. T.02.E1158).

Thiobarbituric acid number (TBA) was determined according to GOST R
55810-2013. The method is based on spectrophotometric measurement of the
intensity of colouration arising from the interaction of fat oxidation
products with thiobarbituric acid, which allows to assess the degree of
oxidative damage of the fat component of meat.

The pH value was determined by potentiometric method. The essence of the
method is the direct measurement of hydrogen ion activity using a glass
electrode potentiometer, which allows to quickly and accurately
determine the acidity of the meat sample under study.

The mass loss of meat samples was calculated from the sample weight
values before heat treatment, and the sample weight values after heat
treatment. The mass loss reflected the weight of the sample after heat
treatment (B) as a percentage of the weight of the sample before heat
treatment (A), as shown by the equation below:

\(Cookloss\ (\%) = \ \left\lbrack \frac{A - B}{A} \right\rbrack?\)100

The organoleptic evaluation of the meat product was carried out in
accordance with GOST 9959-2015 ``Meat and meat products. General
requirements for organoleptic evaluation.''The analysis involved 10
employees and master' s degree students of the Department
of Food Technology of Almaty Technological University (Kazakhstan), who
are already familiar with the criteria for assessing organoleptic
characteristics of products. Participation in the analysis was voluntary
and participants provided verbal consent for the sensory evaluation. The
assessment took place in a well-ventilated room with adequate lighting
and no distractions. Food samples were evenly sliced and chilled to
20°C±2°C, then placed in labeled white plastic plates. For sensory
tests, participants used warm water to cleanse the palate between
samples to eliminate the influence of the previous evaluation on the
next sample. The results of the coded samples were presented as a
sensory scale from 0 to 5 points, where 1 point denotes the lowest score
and 5 points denotes the highest score. This method involves the
systematic assessment of sensory characteristics such as appearance,
color, smell, texture, and taste.The overall score was calculated as the
arithmetic mean of these five parameters.

This study was carried out using the Black Box method.
X\tsb{1} - mass fraction of Acorus calamus rhizome (1\%, 3\%,
5\%) and X\tsb{2} - mass fraction of humic-fulvic acid complex
(0.3\%, 0.5\%, 0.7\%) were selected as variable factors of the
experiment. To investigate the effect of these factors on pH and
thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values, a second-order fractional-factorial
experimental design was applied to obtain reliable results with a
limited number of experimental points. From the total number of
variants, only samples corresponding to key combinations of variables
were physically analyzed. The remaining values were interpolated on the
basis of the constructed regression equations reflecting the dependence
of the studied indicators on the levels X\tsb{1}and
X\tsb{2}.

All experiments were performed at least three times (n ≥ 3). Results are
presented as «mean±standard deviation» (M±SD).

Values obtained by calculation using multiple regression equations are
marked with an asterisk in the tables and graphs to distinguish between
measured and modelled data.

The values of meat loss weight after heat treatment and organoleptic
characteristics were determined using a full factorial experiment.

{\bfseries Results and discussion.} Following the completion of laboratory
analyses and the calculation of values using the regression equation, an
experimental matrix was constructed containing all values of the
resulting factors. (Table 1).

Surface Plot of Y\tsb{1}(pH) against
X\tsb{1}(Calamus Rhizome) and X\tsb{2}(HF Acid
conc.) is shown in Figure 1.

{\bfseries Fig.1 - 3D Surface Plot of Y\tsb{1}(pH) against
X\tsb{1}(Calamus Rhizome) and\\
X\tsb{2}(HF Acid conc.)}

The regression equation for Y\tsb{1}(pH) as a function of X₁
(Calamus Rhizome) and X₂ (HF Acid conc.):

Y\tsb{1}(pH) = 6,7469-0,3417X₁ + 0,3698X₂ -
0,0229X\tsp{2}₁ + 0,1088X₁X₂ - 0,7985X\tsp{2}₂

Regression model performance metrics:R² = 0,9732; R²\_adj = 0,9334;MSₑ =
0,0516;

The response surface analysis (Figure 1) shows that the value of Y₁ (pH)
decreases systematically with increasing levels of factors X₁ (Calamus
Rhizome) and X₂ (HF Acid concentration). The maximum pH value (6,58) is
observed at zero values of the factors, i.e. in the control sample. The
minimum pH values (4,68) were recorded at maximum additive dosages of X₁
= 5\% and X₂ = 0.7\% (p<0,05).

As the doses of both X₁ and X₂ increase, a stable and progressive
decrease in pH value is observed. And the greatest dynamics of decrease
is fixed at simultaneous increase of both factors. This indicates a
synergistic effect of plant components aimed at acidification of the
medium. In the technological context, this can be a positive factor,
since a controlled decrease in pH improves the stability of the product
and affects its structural and mechanical properties.

Surface Plot of Y\tsb{2}(TBA) against
X\tsb{1}(Calamus Rhizome) and X\tsb{2}(HF Acid
conc.) is shown in Figure 2.

\fig{p/image16}{}

{\bfseries Fig.2 - 3D Surface Plot of Y\tsb{2}(TBA) against

The regression equation for Y\tsb{2}(TBA) as a function of X₁
(Calamus Rhizome) and X₂ (HF Acid conc.):

Y\tsb{2} (TBA) = 0,3945 + 0,021X₁ + 0,6567X₂ -
0,008X\tsp{2}₁ - 0,0168X₁X₂ - 0,772X\tsp{2}₂

Regression model performance metrics:R² = 0,9434; R²\_adj = 0,9116;MSₑ =
0,0484;

Response surface analysis (Figure 2) demonstrates that the Y₂ value
(TBA) decreases with increasing concentrations of X₁ (Calamus Rhizome)
and X₂ (HF Acid conc.). According to the experimental matrix data, the
maximum value of TBA is 0,55 mg MDA/kg and it was recorded in sample 1
at minimum levels of factors (X₁ = 1\%, X₂ = 0.3\%). The minimum TBA
value of 0,33 mg MDA/kg is observed in sample 9 at maximum values of X₁
= 5\% and X₂ = 0.7\% (p<0,05).

The response surface has a steady downward profile reflecting a
progressive decrease in lipid oxidation rate as the concentrations of
plant components increase. The most pronounced decrease of Y₂ values is
observed at simultaneous increase of both factors, which indicates their
combined influence on the TBA indicator.

Surface Plot of Y\tsb{3}(CookLoss) against
X\tsb{1}(Calamus Rhizome) and X\tsb{2}(HF Acid
conc.) is shown in Figure 3.

\fig{p/image17}{}

{\bfseries Fig.3 - 3D Surface Plot of Y\tsb{3}(CookLoss) against

The regression equation for Y\tsb{3}(CookLoss) as a function
of X₁ (Calamus Rhizome) and X₂ (HF Acid conc.):

Y\tsb{3}(CookLoss) = 31,7887 - 1,7764X₁ - 24,2074X₂ -
0,1853X\tsp{2}₁ + 2,8265X₁X₂ + 7,0379X\tsp{2}₂

Regression model performance metrics:R² = 0,9816; R²\_adj = 0,9636;MSₑ =
0,0476;

The analysis of the response surface reflecting the dependence of the
mass loss index after heat treatment (Y₃, Cookloss) on the
concentrations of calamus rhizome (X₁) and humic-fulvic acid complex
(X₂) shows a clear tendency to decrease the values of Y₃ with increasing
levels of the studied factors. The maximum weight loss was recorded in
the control sample (X₁ = 0\%, X₂ = 0\%) and was 33.00\%, indicating
significant moisture loss in the absence of vegetable additives. The
minimum Cookloss value was observed at the maximum levels of both
factors, X₁ = 5\% and X₂ = 0.5-0.7\%, and was 13.42-13.86\% (samples 8
and 9) (p<0,05).

The response surface is characterised by a uniform decrease in mass loss
as the dosages of both X₁ and X₂ increase. A particularly pronounced
decrease is observed in the region of high concentrations of
humic-fulvic acids, which confirms their contribution to moisture
retention in the structure of the meat product. The model shows a stable
negative relationship between the level of vegetable additives and
weight loss, indicating an improvement in the moisture retention
capacity of the meat semi-finished product when they are used.

Surface Plot of Y\tsb{4}(Organoleptic) against
X\tsb{1}(Calamus Rhizome) and X\tsb{2}(HF Acid
conc.) is shown in Figure 4.

{\bfseries Fig.4 - 3D Surface Plot of Y\tsb{4}(Organoleptic)

The regression equation for Y\tsb{4}(Organoleptic) as a
function of X₁ (Calamus Rhizome) and X₂ (HF Acid conc.):

Y\tsb{4} (Organoleptic) = 3,9095 + 0,5742X₁ + 0,3228X₂ -

Regression model performance metrics:R² = 0,9524; R²\_adj = 0,9126;MSₑ =
0,0541;

Analysis of the response surface (Figure 4) illustrating the dependence
of organoleptic score (Y₄) on the concentrations of aira rhizome (X₁)
and humic-fulvic acids (X₂) showed the presence of a clearly defined
optimum. The maximum value of Y₄ was 4,92 points and was observed in
sample 6 at X₁ = 3\% and X₂ = 0.7\%. The minimum value of organoleptic
evaluation, 3,91 points, was recorded in the control sample (X₁ = 0\%,
X₂ = 0\%) where there were no plant additives (p<0,05).

The response surface has a dome-shape, indicating the presence of a
region of optimal values of the factors. At low levels of X₁ and X₂, the
meat was characterised by a tough consistency and poor flavour, which is
reflected in a low consumer evaluation. On the contrary, at excessive
dosages of vegetable components (in particular, X₁ = 5\%), a sour and
bitter flavour was observed, caused by the saturation of the product
with biologically active compounds, which also reduced the overall
perception. The highest organoleptic indices corresponded to medium
levels of factors. At these ratios, the product was characterised by a
balanced flavour, moderate textural tenderness and harmonious aroma.

The joint decrease in pH and TBARS achieved by combining the HFA complex
with Acorus calamus rhizome is consistent with two complementary
chemical levers -- polyprotic acid donation and transition-metal
chelation. Humic/fulvic matrices are rich in carboxyl and phenolic sites
that both release H⁺ (lowering pH and shifting buffers) and sequester
Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺, Cu²⁺, curbing metal-catalysed initiation of lipid
peroxidation {[}7-9{]}. Likewise, Klein O.I. et al. systematically
demonstrated that humic materials display peroxyl-radical scavenging
linked to their phenolic/carboxyl functionality, supporting the dual
proton-donor/chelator role {[}10{]}.

From the perspective of oxidation control, TBARS reduction follows the
canonical pathway in which iron catalysis governs initiation and
propagation in muscle lipids. In technologically similar emulsion
systems, Jittrepotch N. et al. showed that the chelator EDTA suppresses
non-heme-iron-catalysed oxidation in sausages, highlighting that metal
control alone can substantially depress TBARS. HFA in research provides
a natural chelation platform with added acidity to modulate the matrix
environment {[}11{]}. Consistently, the review by Bellucci E.R.B. et al.
collates multiple meat-product studies where phenolic extracts lower
TBARS via radical scavenging and partial metal binding, a mode that
parallels the HFA + calamus pairing {[}12{]}.

The acidifying effect observed is attributable to the polyprotic nature
of humic/fulvic structures (multiple pK\_a domains) and the phenolic
pool in calamus. Proton release reduces the effective buffer capacity of
the meat system and can reposition protein solubility relative to the
myofibrillar isoelectric region-mechanistic features consistent with the
spectroscopy-guided view of humic reactivity {[}13{]}. In parallel,
Parki A. et al. documented that \emph{A. calamus} essential oil
compositions vary seasonally yet retain pronounced radical-quenching
potential, aligning with our use of calamus as a phenolic proton source
and antioxidant partner to HFA {[}14{]}.

Regarding the pumpkin seed cake, our findings reflect the well-known
trade-off between matrix-level water binding and PUFA enrichment. The
cake's dietary fibres and proteins create capillary and gel-type binding
sites that limit thermal drip, which rationalises the cooking-loss
decrease. At the same time, the high linoleic (ω-6) fraction heightens
the oxidative liability unless antioxidant protection is present
{[}15{]}. Likewise, Öztürk \& Turhan reported that pumpkin seed kernel
flour used in beef meatballs improved cooking yield but altered TBARS
dynamics during storage due to PUFA enrichment {[}16{]}. Similarly,
Gadekar Y.P. et al. summarised that 3\% pumpkin seed flour can replace
fat and improve yield while necessitating oxidation management-a balance
we achieve here by coupling the cake with HFA + calamus {[}17{]}.

The additional TBARS decrease when calamus accompanies HFA is credibly
ascribed to polyphenolic radical quenching that complements HFA
chelation {[}18{]}. In concordance, Dinev T. et al. showed strong
antioxidant capacity for methanolic \emph{A. calamus} extracts, and
clinical-pharmacognosy summaries note potent DPPH and
β-carotene/linoleate antioxidant activity for calamus essential
oil-evidence that translates to meat systems where lipid-radical
propagation drives TBARS accumulation. Thus, our dual-mode intervention
(chelation + radical quenching) mirrors the combined strategies that
outperform single-mode antioxidants in comminuted meats {[}19{]}.

On sensory and yield, the net improvement at moderate calamus levels is
consistent with phenolic--protein network effects and matrix water
immobilisation: modest phenolic inputs can tighten the heat-set network
without introducing off-notes, while the cake's fibres/proteins supply
structural water binding that offsets the pH-induced shift toward lower
WHC. Likewise, de Melo F.A.B. et al. reported that pumpkin-derived
solids enhance yield in burger systems at practical inclusion levels,
provided that oxidation is actively managed---a condition satisfied in
our design by the HFA + calamus synergy {[}20{]}.

Based on data from technological regulatory documents for meat products,
quality parameter limits were established to ensure an optimal balance
between safety, stability, and organoleptic characteristics. In
particular, the optimal pH range was determined to be 5.6--6.0, which
provides both safety and acceptable texture. The threshold value for TBA
should not exceed 0.5 mg MDA/kg, as higher values indicate the
development of oxidative processes. Cook loss should be minimized, as it
directly affects the juiciness and yield of the final product.
Conversely, the organoleptic score should approach the maximum level,
reflecting the flavor, aroma, and texture perceived by consumers.
According to the combined assessment of all four parameters, the best
result was obtained for Sample 6, which contained 3\% Acorus calamus
rhizome and 0.7\% humic-fulvic acid complex: pH - 5.57, TBA - 0.43 mg
MDA/kg, cook loss - 17.01\%, and organoleptic score - 4.92, making it
the optimal formulation in terms of the qualitative characteristics of
the meat product.

{\bfseries Conclusion.} The results of this study clearly demonstrate the
high effectiveness of plant-based components-acorus calamus rhizome, a
humic-fulvic acid complex, and pumpkin seed press cake---in the
production of meat products. It was established that the addition of the
humic-fulvic acid complex and Acorus calamus rhizome enables controlled
reduction of pH and TBA due to their acidic, chelating, and antioxidant
properties, thereby strengthening oxidative and physicochemical
stability of the product.The pumpkin seed press cake exhibited
functional and technological properties as a moisture-retaining matrix,
significantly reducing mass loss and improving flavor and aroma
characteristics.

Based on the integrated analysis of all measured parameters and
considering the established technological limits, the sample containing
3\% Acorus calamus rhizome and 0.7\% of the humic-fulvic acid complex,
with the following values: pH - 5.57, TBA - 0.43 mg MDA/kg, cook loss -
17.01\%, and organoleptic score - 4.92 was identified as the optimal
formulation.

For a comprehensive assessment of the functionality of the studied plant
components, further research is needed to investigate the stability of
the meat product during storage, including the dynamics of changes in
acid, peroxide, and thiobarbituric values over time. The current
findings confirm the antioxidant potential of Acorus calamus rhizome and
the humic-fulvic acid complex, justifying their application as natural
inhibitors of oxidative processes in meat products.
