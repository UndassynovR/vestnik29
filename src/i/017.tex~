Evaluation of scientific and scientific-technical projects is a
multifaceted task that requires a balanced approach to the analysis of
innovativeness, feasibility and potential impact of research
initiatives. Traditional methods of expert evaluation are based on
subjective conclusions of specialists, which create risks of
inconsistency and limited reproducibility of solutions. In this regard,
the importance of intelligent information systems that can improve the
quality, transparency and efficiency of evaluation procedures is
increasing. The article presents a comprehensive review of architectural
solutions, network models and technologies used in information systems
designed to support expert evaluation of scientific projects. Both
classical knowledge-based approaches and modern solutions using
artificial intelligence methods are considered: machine learning,
natural language processing (NLP), fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms.
Particular attention is paid to the use of blockchain technologies to
ensure the reliability, security and auditability of expert procedures.
Key decision support methods are analyzed, including multi-criteria
analysis methods, optimization algorithms, and automated distribution of
applications between experts. Examples of successful implementation of
cloud and distributed architectures in the scientific expertise system
are presented.

{\bfseries Keywords:} intelligent systems, expert assessment, scientific
projects, information systems, systems architecture, machine learning
(ML), fuzzy logic, blockchain, multi-criteria analysis, natural language

{\bfseries Introduction.} The development of scientific research activities
and increasing competition for funding pose the challenge for the
scientific community to modernize the procedures for assessing and
reviewing projects. The existing practice of expert evaluation is
usually manual, fragmented and subjective. This reduces the efficiency
of research program management, increases the risks of unreliable
decisions, and complicates the scalability of the process with an
increase in the volume of submitted applications. In the context of
digitalization and growing data volumes, it becomes necessary to move
from the traditional expert model to intelligent information systems
capable of providing a more accurate, objective and reproducible
assessment of projects {[}1{]}.

The object of the study is information systems designed to assess
scientific and scientific-technical projects.

The purpose of this work is to form a holistic view of the architecture,
technologies and algorithms underlying intelligent expert evaluation
systems, as well as to identify areas for their further development and
application in the practice of scientific administration.

The relevance of the topic is due to the growing interest in digital
platforms for decision support in science, the emergence of new
technological solutions, as well as state policy in the field of digital
transformation of science. Despite the availability of private
solutions, a systematic review combining architectural, algorithmic and
applied aspects of designing such systems is still insufficient in
scientific literature. This creates a methodological gap between IS
developers and specialists in the field of scientific expertise.

The scientific novelty of the study lies in the integrated approach to
systematizing existing solutions: from classical expert systems and
multi-criteria models to modern methods of machine learning, automated
annotation, application distribution, blockchain registries and cloud
architecture. The work offers a comparative analysis of the approaches
used in the literature over the past ten years, with an emphasis on
their applicability in scientific practice.

The hypothesis of the study is that the use of modular architectures and
hybrid AI models in information systems can significantly improve the
quality, transparency and adaptability of expert assessment processes.

{\bfseries Materials and Methods.}The methodological basis of this study is
a systematic review aimed at identifying, classifying and analyzing
architectural solutions, technologies and algorithms used in intelligent
information systems designed to evaluate scientific and
scientific-technical projects.

The study was conducted in several stages:

1. Formulating criteria for selecting publications.

The review included scientific articles published between 2015 and 2025,
primarily in English-language peer-reviewed journals indexed in the
Scopus, IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink, ACM DL databases, as well as in
authoritative Kazakh and Russian sources. The main selection criteria
were:

- focus on expert evaluation information systems;

- availability of a description of the architecture, models or
algorithms used;

- practical focus of solutions.

Articles devoted exclusively to administrative, sociological or
political aspects of scientific expertise without a technical component
were excluded.

2. Search and selection of sources.

To ensure complete coverage, the following keywords were used: expert
evaluation systems, project assessment, decision support systems, AI in
research evaluation, scientific project management, fuzzy logic,
blockchain for science, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). At the
first stage, more than 40 publications were identified, of which 25 most
relevant sources were selected after reference analysis.

3. Classification and systematization of data.

The publications were analyzed according to the following parameters:

- type of architecture;

- type of technologies used;

- decision-making methods used;

- scope and maturity stage.

4. Analysis of methods and algorithms.

Particular attention is paid to the analysis of algorithmic solutions:

- decision support systems based on multi-criteria models;

- machine learning methods for analyzing application texts and
predicting;

- optimization algorithms;

- transparency technologies.

Each method was described in the context of its applicability to the
task of scientific expertise, and its advantages and limitations were
considered.

\emph{Architecture of intelligent assessment systems}

Developing an intelligent project evaluation system requires a
well-defined architecture that integrates data, expert knowledge, and
analytical models. Early approaches often took the form of
knowledge-based expert systems, where domain rules and criteria guided
project evaluations. For example, Mutanov et al. {[}2{]} developed a
decision support methodology using mathematical models to evaluate
innovative projects along two key dimensions, ``innovativeness'' (I) and
``competitiveness'' (K), visualizing each project as a point on a K=f(I)
matrix for expert panels. This architecture formalized how scientific
and business metrics intersect in project value and allowed experts to
compare projects using a graphical decision map. Such rule-based or
model-driven architectures lay the foundation by defining the criteria,
metrics, and workflow for evaluation. Modern intelligent system
architectures increasingly use cloud and network technologies to improve
collaboration and scalability.

A prominent example is the remote peer review system developed by Yu et
al. for urban planning projects {[}3{]}. The system architecture uses a
cloud service platform to pool information resources and remote experts,
enabling online project reviews even in resource-constrained regions.
Key features include shared data repositories, GIS tools for spatial
analysis, and secure access for geographically distributed evaluators.
By virtualizing resources using cloud computing, this architecture
achieves the integration of various data sources and supports a seamless
workflow between multiple users, thereby improving the efficiency and
``scientific nature'' of the review process. This illustrates how
distributed architecture can modernize the peer review process for
scientific projects.

Another important architectural trend is the incorporation of blockchain
networks into the system design. Blockchain technology, originally known
as cryptocurrency, is now seen as a ``software connector'' that can link
system components in a decentralized, tamper-proof manner. Xu et al.
described blockchain as a new connector in software architecture that
can ensure data integrity and trust between distributed modules {[}4{]}.
In project evaluation systems, this implies that project proposals,
reviews, and decisions can be recorded on a blockchain ledger to prevent
unauthorized changes and improve transparency. Zyskind et al.
demonstrated how blockchain can be used to protect personal data by
decentralizing access control {[}5{]}. By applying this, an evaluation
system can protect sensitive information about proposals while allowing
authorized experts to access the data through cryptographic keys.

In general, the architecture of an intelligent project evaluation system
is often modular, combining a data layer, an intelligence layer, and an
interface layer. Indeed, national science management strategies are
moving towards unified digital ecosystems: for example, the concept of
science development in Kazakhstan for 2023--2029 envisages the creation
of a unified information system ``Science of Kazakhstan'', which
digitalizes all scientific processes using data science, big data, and
other digital tools {[}1{]}.

\emph{Network Models and AI Methods in Project Evaluation}

Intelligent systems use advanced AI models or ``network models'' to
analyze and interpret the complex data used in project evaluation. By
``network models'' in this context, we mean neural networks and deep
learning models that have revolutionized the processing of unstructured
data. In a review, Jordan and Mitchell identified machine learning as a
transformative technology and predicted that learning algorithms will
increasingly work collaboratively and process multiple data sources
{[}6{]}. Indeed, modern intelligent evaluation systems use a combination
of AI models:

- Natural language processing (NLP) and text mining: Project proposals
and research papers contain a lot of text. Deep learning models can
analyze documents to extract key information. Recent research has led to
the creation of large-scale datasets and models for summarizing multiple
documents. For example, the Multi-News dataset presented by Fabbri et
al. contains thousands of clusters of news articles with summaries,
allowing neural models to learn to generate consistent summaries from
multiple sources {[}7{]}. Building on this, Lu et al. created
Multi-XScience, a dataset for summarizing multiple scientific articles
related to a given topic {[}8{]}. Akhmetov et al. proposed an extractive
summarization method for scientific articles based on greedy
optimization, demonstrating how AI can automatically highlight the most
important sentences in a paper {[}9{]}. Integrating such summarization
tools into an expert system allows a reviewer to instantly obtain a
summary of the literature on a sentence or previous results, saving time
and improving understanding.

- Knowledge graphs and semantic networks: Intelligent systems can
represent domain knowledge as concept graphs, for example by linking
projects to related scientific fields, experts, or previous works. This
helps recommend suitable expert reviewers or identify collaboration
opportunities {[}10-12{]}.

- Plagiarism and integrity checking: Ensuring the originality of
submissions is an important part of project review. Machine learning
techniques have improved plagiarism detection by learning patterns of
textual similarity. Kamath and Ghosh proposed a machine learning
approach to plagiarism detection that can be used to compare a new
submission with a database of existing documents to detect potential
copying {[}13{]}.

- Question and answering and information retrieval: Domain-specific
question and answer systems can help experts find facts quickly. Sabieva
et al. developed a legal question answering system that uses machine
learning to extract accurate answers from legal texts {[}14{]}.
Similarly, a quality assurance module in a project appraisal system
could allow an expert to ask questions such as ``What was the success
rate of projects in area X last year?'' or ``What projects similar to
this one have been funded before?'' and receive an immediate answer from
a knowledge base.

- Deep learning for forecasting: Neural network models are also used to
predict project outcomes or estimates. Given enough historical data, a
model can be trained to predict the probability of success. LeCun et al.
noted that deep learning enables multi-layered representation learning,
achieving remarkable results in pattern recognition and forecasting
tasks {[}15{]}. Sikimić and Radovanović attempted to use machine
learning to predict project performance in high-energy physics proposals
but found that accurately predicting project success based on proposal
data alone is non-trivial {[}16{]}. This highlights that while neural
models are powerful, their predictions must complement human expert
judgment.

\emph{Decision Support Methods and Algorithms}

In addition to the architecture and artificial intelligence components,
intelligent project evaluation systems rely on a large literature on
decision support methodologies. Project selection is inherently a
multi-criteria decision problem, where there are several evaluation
criteria that need to be considered simultaneously {[}17{]}. Many
quantitative methods have been developed and applied over the past
decades:

- Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods: classical methods such
as Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Analytic Network Process (ANP),
TOPSIS, DEMATEL. For example, AHP allows pairwise comparison of projects
for each criterion to obtain priority scores, while ANP extends this by
considering interdependencies between criteria. Integrated approaches
are also common: researchers combine to exploit their complementary
strengths. Also, an expert system can use a knowledge base of rules to
determine the appropriate MCDM method in each context, then perform
calculations and present a ranked list of projects to decision makers
{[}18-20{]}.

- Fuzzy logic and uncertainty handling: Evaluation of scientific
projects often involves uncertainty - data may be incomplete, expert
judgments may be subjective. Fuzzy logic provides the ability to model
uncertain or imprecise information. Many of the above-mentioned MCDM
methods have fuzzy extensions to account for ambiguity in expert
assessments. The integration of fuzzy sets allows an intelligent system
to reason in linguistic terms (``high risk'', ``moderate
innovativeness'') and still perform quantitative analysis. This leads to
more robust decision support that can reflect confidence levels or
variations in expert opinions {[}21-24{]}.

- Optimization algorithms: project selection may require portfolio
optimization under constraints. Evolutionary algorithms and other
optimizers play a role here. Genetic algorithms (GAs), described by
Goldberg, mimic natural selection to find optimal solutions and have
been applied to project selection problems {[}25{]}. Esengalieva
investigated GA in the context of evaluating research projects that are
likely to optimize the combination of projects that maximize the overall
benefit under given constraints {[}26{]}. Similarly, researchers have
used data envelopment analysis (DEA) to measure project performance by
treating projects as decision units transforming inputs into outputs.
For example, Namazi et al. used a fuzzy DEA approach to evaluate the
performance of R\&D projects under uncertainty {[}27{]}. These
optimization and performance analysis techniques can be embedded in
intelligent systems to suggest an optimal set of projects or identify
inefficient projects.

- Automated reviewer assignment: Intelligent decision support can help
here by modeling the expertise and workload of reviewers. Liu et al.
presented an approach to intelligent assignment of reviewers for
research project selection, implemented as an assignment decision
support system {[}28{]}. Their system analyzes project topics and
reviewer profiles to recommend optimal reviewer-project matches. This
type of subsystem is often part of the overall architecture of modern
grant management platforms.

To provide a structured overview of the technological components used in
intelligent project evaluation systems, Table 1 summarizes the key
methods, their core purposes, and supporting literature. The table
consolidates architectural solutions, artificial intelligence
techniques, and decision support tools that collectively enhance the
objectivity, efficiency, and transparency of evaluation processes.

{\bfseries Results and Discussion.} This study allowed us to systematize
and analyze modern architectural and algorithmic solutions used in
information systems designed for expert evaluation of scientific and
technical projects. The review covers publications over the past ten
years, primarily from the Scopus and IEEE databases, as well as several
significant domestic sources, which ensures a broad coverage of both the
international and local context.

\emph{Architectural solutions and structural approaches}

The analysis showed that three main types of architecture are most
widely represented: centralized, modular, and distributed. Centralized
solutions are typical for internal systems of universities and
foundations, where all processes - from applying to forming a rating -
are closed within a single platform. Such systems are relatively easy to
implement, but they are poorly scalable and vulnerable to the human
factor.

Modular architecture, on the contrary, demonstrates a high potential for
adaptability. They assume the presence of separate components: data
storage, analytics, interfaces for interaction with experts, as well as
subsystems for analyzing scientific information. Such solutions are
easier to scale and integrate with external services, including
international databases of scientific publications. Platforms that
support API integration with ORCID, Scopus, and Web of Science
demonstrate higher flexibility and relevance of data.

Distributed and cloud solutions deserve special attention. Some
publications propose conceptual models based on blockchain technologies
that ensure transparency, immutability, and decentralization of
examination processes. However, such approaches have not yet been widely
used in existing systems and require additional research in terms of
their legal and organizational support.

\emph{Evaluation algorithms and intelligent methods}

Among algorithmic solutions, the most widely used are multi-criteria
analysis methods: AHP, TOPSIS, ANP and their modifications with elements
of fuzzy logic (Fuzzy AHP). They are used both to form project ratings
and to rank the evaluation criteria themselves - such as scientific
novelty, compliance with priorities, expected return,
applicant' s reputation, etc.

In recent years, there has been a noticeable increase in interest in the
use of machine learning methods. The areas of automatic classification
of projects, predicting their success, as well as automated
summarization of the substantive part of applications using natural
language processing (NLP) models are developing especially actively.
This allows them to partially relieve experts and speed up the primary
sorting process.

Optimization methods, in particular genetic algorithms, are also used in
the tasks of distributing applications among experts considering their
specialization, conflicts of interest and workload. Such approaches
ensure a fairer and more balanced distribution and minimize the
influence of the subjective factor.

\emph{Practical aspects of integration and application}

In practice, the greatest difficulty is integration with external
systems and platforms, especially with international scientific
databases. It was found that only a limited number of solutions provide
full API support for verifying data on publications, patents, and other
results of scientific activity.

In addition, compatibility issues between various assessment systems,
including within one state, were identified, which complicates the
implementation of uniform standards and unified approaches. Several
studies note the need to create a reference architecture - a universal
template based on which it is possible to design flexible and adaptive
expert platforms.

\emph{Critical comments and limitations of existing solutions}

Despite the high degree of elaboration of individual components, most
systems are still at the prototype or pilot implementation stage. Common
limitations are fragmentary architectures, weak automation of processes,
low reproducibility of expert assessments, as well as the lack of tools
for interpreting results based on the principles of Explainable AI.

Many proposed solutions are not accompanied by sufficient empirical
validation. This complicates an objective assessment of their
effectiveness and applicability in real conditions, especially in public
scientific management systems.

\emph{Current trends and promising areas}

Based on the analysis, several key trends can be identified:

- Active implementation of hybrid systems that combine expert
assessments with AI algorithms;

- Growing interest in Explainable AI in decision-making tasks in the
scientific field;

- The emergence of distributed models based on blockchain to ensure
transparency and traceability of procedures;

- Development of digital platforms with the ability to customize to the
specifics of various grant competitions and scientific programs.

{\bfseries Conclusion.} The evaluation of scientific projects is evolving
from traditional expert-based approaches towards more intelligent,
automated, and transparent systems. This review has outlined a wide
range of architectural solutions, AI-driven methods, and
decision-support algorithms applied to the expert assessment process.
Modular and distributed architectures, often enhanced with cloud and
blockchain technologies, allow for better scalability, traceability, and
collaboration among stakeholders. Methods such as fuzzy logic,
multi-criteria analysis, and genetic algorithms address the complexity
and uncertainty inherent in research evaluation, while natural language
processing and machine learning streamline the analysis of unstructured
data.

Despite promising developments, most current systems remain in
experimental or pilot stages, facing challenges related to
standardization, integration, and explainability. Future research should
focus on building interoperable, customizable platforms that combine
expert knowledge with transparent AI algorithms and provide measurable
improvements in the efficiency and fairness of the evaluation process.
The emergence of explainable AI and integration with international data
infrastructures will play a key role in the next generation of
intelligent evaluation systems for scientific and technical projects.
